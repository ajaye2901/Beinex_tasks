# Create a class named Notes for handling text-based file operations. Class should contain methods 
# "write", "read" and then "append" as instance methods or class methods. (Can contain any other methods if you wish) 
# Use a single file for saving the notes. You can set the file name as a constant somewhere in the program (Or as a class variable).
# write method should create the if it doesn't exist, Then it should overwrite the older contents 
# with the user input if the user plans to overwrite the file. read method should read the whole file 
# contents and return it. If the file doesn't exist, then it should return "No notes found" append method should take the 
# user input value and it must add the value to the end of the file. It must not overwrite the file. 
# Now create a program to utilize this class. The program should repeatedly ask the user for these 4 choices : 
# 1 - Write Note (Overwrite existing). 
# 2 - Add more Notes (Append). 
# 3 - Read Notes. 
# 4 â€“ Exit
